## What is Supro and why ? 

**Supro** is a online shop website layout. Our team's mission was to integrate a design using HTML & CSS. 
The project can be considered as the **Becode** **_"Field" step's_** final project of our promo **Jepsen 4.27 (2021)**.

## What did we used exactly ? 

- **HTML** ( *Captain Obvious is on holiday, I'm his substitute* )

- **Bootstrap** which is a CSS Framework, really useful and practical one, adapted to the project's needs. 


## Status ? 

Welln theorically it's finished. But as you can see, our performances can be improved so ... why not return on it for fun later ? If so and that you did'nt forgot about our existence, you will eventually see it in a further section named "Gitlog" ;)
